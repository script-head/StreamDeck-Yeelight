# Stream Deck Yeelight integration

basic as fuck integration for controlling yeelights with a stream deck. bulbs have to have LAN mode enabled. this code is ass and needs to be completely re-done as this code fucking sucks but i dont care because it works good enough for me right now. when i have to add more bulbs ill re-write shit.

in theory u could use this on anything that will do web requests
